                I am an entry-level narrative designer with basic knowledge of the most popular game engines, proficiency in software commonly used by narrative designers, familiarity with 
                storytelling rules, great passion for games and sometimes funny jokes. My main interests lie in branching quests and design implementation. I enjoy teamwork and always seek 
                opportunities to learn from my colleagues. </br>

                happy to be challenged.
