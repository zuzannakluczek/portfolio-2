                I am an entry-level narrative designer with basic knowledge of the most popular game engines, proficiency in software commonly used by narrative designers, familiarity with 
                storytelling rules, great passion for games and sometimes funny jokes. My main interests lie in branching quests and design implementation. I enjoy teamwork and always seek 
                opportunities to learn from my colleagues. Genres that play out for me the best are psychological horror, action and romance. When it comes to experimenting and trying out something new, however, I am always
                happy to be challenged.  </br></br>
                Currently, I am enrolled at Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun, Poland. With an individual studies programme, my education is directed towards communications, social science and game studies. Ending with a bachelor's diploma of journalism & communication, 
                this three-years-long plan gives me opportunity to focus on my own research. For now, my work concerns community of gamers and female representation in mainstream media. </br></br>
